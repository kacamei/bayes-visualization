# PPV Simulation Project

This project simulates and visualizes how Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of a SARS-CoV-2 home test varies
depending on the disease prevalence and specificity of the test.

## Context
- **Sensitivity:** Fixed at 99%
- **Specificity:** Tested at different levels (99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%)
- **Prevalence:** Ranges from 0.001% to 50%

## Files
- `ppv_visualization.py`: Python script with the simulation
- `ppv_plot.png`: Output graph (generated when you run the script)
